#' Sum by group, in parallel
#'
#' @description Like [rowsum()], with the same results: the sum of `x` within
#'   each group, or of each column of a matrix. Base R takes about a second
#'   for 10 million values; this sums the groups on several threads, each
#'   group's values in their order, as base R does, so the sums agree to the
#'   last bit.
#'
#' @details Integer and double vectors and matrices with at least 1e4 rows
#'   are summed in Rust. Anything else goes to base R, such as data frames.
#'   Integer sums that overflow give `NA`, as in base R.
#'
#' @inheritParams base::rowsum
#' @inheritParams par_match
#'
#' @returns As [rowsum()]: a matrix with a row per group, named by the
#'   groups, sorted unless `reorder = FALSE`, and a column per column of `x`.
