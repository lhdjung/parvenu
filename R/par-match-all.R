#' All matches, not just the first
#'
#' @description `par_match()` and `par_match_rows()` give the first match of
#'   each element or row of `x` in `table`. These give all of them, as pairs
#'   of positions: a many-to-many join, such as [merge()] does on key columns.
#'
#'   - `par_match_all()` for vectors, compared as `par_match()` compares them.
#'   - `par_match_rows_all()` for rows, compared as `par_match_rows()`
#'   compares them.
#'
#'   With `x` and `table` the same, the pairs are all groups of equal
#'   elements, including each element paired with itself.
#'
#' @details Both sides are hashed once, by `par_match(x, table)` and
#'   `par_match(table, table)` (or the row versions), which number the
#'   groups of equal elements by their first position in `table`. The
#'   positions in `table` are then sorted by group, and each element of `x`
#'   is paired with the run of its group, so the work beyond the two lookups
#'   is linear in the number of pairs.
#'
#'   The number of pairs can be much larger than either input: 1e5 equal
#'   elements on each side make 1e10. It is counted before any pair is
#'   built, and more than 2^31 - 1 pairs are an error.
#'
#' @inheritParams par_match_rows
#'
#' @returns A data frame with one row per pair, sorted by `x` and then by
#'   `table`: `x`, a position in `x` (or row of `x`), and `table`, a
#'   position in `table` equal to it. Elements of `x` with no match in
#'   `table` have no rows.
